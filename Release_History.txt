* Implementation of TimerPeriod is no longer a trait, but a struct. The calendar 
  required for BusinessDaily time period is now an external parameter. This seems
  to be a better choice, since a calendar is more a parameter than part of a method.
  Calendars may also be subject to chance, though only rarely.
